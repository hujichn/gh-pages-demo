The primary problem in bike-sharing systems is the uneven distribution of bicycles. To rebalance bikes, one key point is to firstly analyze and predict the usage demand. In this work, we established a spatio-temperal mobility model of bikes, and presented a novel traffic prediction mechanism. More details can be found in our MobiSys 2016 paper "[Mobility Modeling and Prediction in Bike-Sharing Systems][2]". Thanks for watching!
